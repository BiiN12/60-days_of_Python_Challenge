# 🐍 60 Days of Python Challenge

This repository contains my daily progress as I learn Python from zero to pro in 60 days.
The challenge and daily plan are **provided by ChatGPT** to guide me from Python basics to full-stack development.

Each day has:

- 📖 A lesson
- 🛠 A coding exercise
- ✅ My solution

## 📅 Challenge Plan

Based on my background as a front-end web developer, this challenge focuses on:

- Python basics & mindset shift from JavaScript
- Problem-solving & algorithms
- Backend development with Flask/FastAPI
- Databases (SQL & ORM)
- Automation & scripting
- Real-world projects
